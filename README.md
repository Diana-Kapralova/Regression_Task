# Regression_Task
Regression Task for Quantum

# Task
You have a dataset (internship_train.csv) that contains 53 anonymized features and a target column. Your task is to build model that predicts a target based on the proposed features. Please provide predictions for internship_hidden_test.csv file. Target metric is RMSE. The main goal is to provide github repository that contains:
* jupyter notebook with analysis; 
* code for modeling (Python 3); 
* file with model predictions; 
* **readme file**;
* requirements.txt file.

## Analylis
Analysis reaserch of data are located in file `Analysis_of_Data.ipynb`.

## Modeling
Modeling are located on file `Modeling Jupyter.ipynb`

## Data
Data is located in `data_files` folder. Includes:
* Train data: `internship_train.csv`
* Test data: `internship_hidden_test.csv`
* Predicted data: `internship_test_PREDICTION.csv`. Predicted data contain columns that left after modelling and take a part in predictions, and PREDICTION itself.
